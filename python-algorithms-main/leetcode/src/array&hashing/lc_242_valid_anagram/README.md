# [LC 242. Valid Anagram - Easy](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/description/)

Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

### Example 1
```
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
```

### Example 2
```
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false
```

### Example 3
```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]
Output: true
```

### Constraints:

- 1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 10^4
- s and t consist of lowercase English letters.
