Given the root of a binary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodes' values.

### Example 1

![PreOrder Traversal Example 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/15/inorder_1.jpg)  


```
Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
Output: [3,2,1]
```

### Example 2

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

### Example 3

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]
```

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100
