# [LC 102. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal - Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal/description/)

You are given the root of a binary search tree (BST), where the values of exactly two nodes of the tree were swapped by mistake. Recover the tree without changing its structure.


### Example 1

```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[3],[9,20],[15,7]]
```

### Example 2

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: [[1]]
```

### Example 3

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```


### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 2000].
- -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
