# [Shortest Path in Weighted undirected graph](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/shortest-path-in-weighted-undirected-graph/1)


You are given a weighted undirected graph having n vertices numbered from 0 to n-1 and m edges describing there are edges between a to b with some weight.   
find the shortest path between the vertex 0 and the vertex n-1 and if path does not exist then return a list consisting of only -1.

### Example 1

```
Input:
n = 5, 
m= 6,
edge=[[1,2,2], [2,5,5], [2,3,4], [1,4,1],[4,3,3],[3,5,1]]

Output: [1 4 3 5]

Explanation: Shortest path from 0 to n-1 is by the path [1 4 3 5]
```
