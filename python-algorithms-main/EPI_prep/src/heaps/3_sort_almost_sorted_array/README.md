# Sort An Almost Sorted Array

Write a Program which takes as input a very long sequence of numbers and prints the numbers in sorted order. Each number is at most k away from its correctly sorted position. 
(Such an array is sometimes referred to as being k-sorted.) For example,no number in the sequence(3, -1,2,6,4,5,8] is more than 2 away from its final sorted position.

- How many numbers must you read after reading the ith number to be sure you can place it in the correct location?

### Example 1
- input:  [3,-1,2,6,4,5,8], k = 2
- output: [-1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8]

### Example 2
- input:  [-4, 0, 1, -3,], k = 3
- output: [-4, -3, 0, 1]
