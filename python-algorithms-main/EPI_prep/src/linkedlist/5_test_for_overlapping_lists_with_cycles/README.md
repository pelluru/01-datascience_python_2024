# Test For Overlapping List - Lists Are Cycle Free

Given two singly linked lists there may be list nodes that are common to both. (This may not be a bug-it may be desirable from the perspective of reducing memory footprint, as in the flyweight pattern, or maintaining a canonical form).   
For example, the lists in Figure below overlap at Node I.  

- Write a Program that takes two singly linked lists where the lists may each or both have a cycle, and determines if there exists a node that is common to both lists.

- *Hint*: Use case analysis. What if both lists have cycles? What if they end in a common cycle? What if one list has cycle and the other does not?
