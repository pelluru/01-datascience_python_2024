# Reverse A Sublist

Write a program which takes a singly linked list L and two integers s and f as arguments, and reverses the order of the nodes from the sth node to fth node, inclusive.   
The numbering begins at 1., i.e., the head node is the first node. Do not allocate additional nodes.  

Write a program that takes two lists, assumed to be sorted, and returns their merge. The only field your program can change in a node is its next field.

### Example 1
- input: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11], s = 2, f = 4  
- output = [2, 7, 5, 3, 11]
