# Merge Two Sorted Doubly Linked Lists

Consider two doubly linked lists in which each node holds a number. Assume the lists are sorted, i.e., numbers in the lists appear in ascending order within each list.   
The *merge* of the two lists is a list consisting of the nodes of the two lists in which numbers appear in ascending order.


Write a program that takes two lists, assumed to be sorted, and returns their merge. The only field your program can change in a node is its next field.
