# Test For Cyclicity


Write a program that takes the head of a singly linked list and retums null if there does not exist a cycle, and the node at the start of the cycle, if a cycle is present.  
 (You do not know the length of the list in advance.)

- *Hint*: Consider using two iterators, one fast and one slow.
