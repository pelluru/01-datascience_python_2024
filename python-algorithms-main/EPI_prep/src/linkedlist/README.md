# LinkedLists

A list implements an ordered collection of values, which may include repetitions. Sepcifically, a singly linked list is a data structure that 
contains a sequence of nodes such that each node contains an object and a reference to the next node in the list.   
The first node is referred to as the head and the last node is referred to as the tail; the tail's next field is null.
There are many variants of linked lists, e.g, tn a doubly linked list, each node has a link to its predecessor;

A list is similar to an array in that it contains objects in a linear order. 
The key differences are that inserting and deleting elements in a list has time complexity O(1).   
On the other hand, obtaining the kth element in a list is expensive, having O(n) time complexity.
Lists are usually building blocks of more complex data structures.  
Below are examples of a singly linkedlist and a doubly linkedlist.

For all problems in this section, unless otherwise stated, each node has two entries 
- a data field, and a next field, which points to the next node in the list, with the next field of the last node being null.   
Its prototype is as follows:   

```

  class ListNode:
    def __init__(self , data=0, next-node=None)
      self.data = data self.next = next-node

```   


## LinkedList Bootcamp
There are two types of list-related problems  
- those where you have to implement your own list, 
- and those where you have to exploit the standard list library.  
We will review both these aspects here, starting with implementation.

Implementing a basic list APl-search, insert, delete-for singly linked lists is an excellent way to become comfortable with lists.

### Search for a key
```
  def search_list (L, key): 
    while L and L.data != key
      L = L. next

    # If key was not present in the List, L will have become null 
    return L
```  

### Insert a new node after a specified node
```

  # Insert new_node after node. 
  def insert_after(node, new_node):
    new_node.next = node.next 
    node.next = new_node

```

### Delete a node:
```
  
  def delete_node(node):
    node = node.next


  #Delete the node past this one. Assume node is not a tail
  def delete_after(node):
    node.next = node.next.next

```

## Top Tips

-  List problems often have a brute force that uses O(n) space, but a subtler solution that uses the existing list nodes to reduce space complexity to O(1)

- Very often, a problem on lists is conceptually simple, and is more about cleanly coding what's specified, rather than designing an algorithm.

- Consider using a dummy head (sometimes referred to as a sentinel) to avoid having to check for empty lists. This simplifies code, and makes bugs less likely.

- It's easy to forget to update next (and previous for double linked list) for the head and tail.

- Algorithms operating on singly linked lists often benefit from using two iterators, one ahead of the otheq, or one advancing quicker than the other.
