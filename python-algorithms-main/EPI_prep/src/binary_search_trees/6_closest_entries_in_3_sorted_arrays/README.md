# Find The Closest Entries In Three Sorted Arrays

<br>

Design an algorithm that takes three sorted arrays and returns one entry from each such that the minimum interval containing these three entries is as small as possible.



### Example 1
Input: [[5,10,15], [3,6,9,12,15],[8,16,24]]
Output: [15,15,16] 
Explanation: since this array [15, 15, 16] has the minimum interval
