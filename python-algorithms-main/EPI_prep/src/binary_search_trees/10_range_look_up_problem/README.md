# The Range Lookup Problem

<br>

Write a program that takes as input a BST and an interval and returns the BST keys that lie in the interval

<br>

- Hint: How many edges are traversed when the successor function is repeatedly called m times?

<br>

### Examples 
In Figure below
- if the interval is [2, 5], you should return [2, 3, 5]
- if the interval is [16, 31], you should return [17, 19, 23, 29, 31]
- if the interval is [31, 53], you should return [31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53]
