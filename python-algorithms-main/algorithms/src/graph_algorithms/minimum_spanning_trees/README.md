# Minimum Spanning Tree

## What is a Spanning Tree?

A spanning tree is a subset of a graph that includes all the graph's vertices and some of the edges of the original graph, intending to have no cycles. A spanning tree is not necessarily unique - it is possible for there to be multiple spanning trees for a given graph.  

 However, a given graph will always have at least one spanning tree. The edges in a spanning tree are called "branch edges," while the edges not in the spanning tree are called "cycle edges." And this type of graph helps find the minimum number of edges required to connect all vertices in a graph. It is also used to create minimally secured networks with redundant paths.

## What is a Minimum Spanning Tree? 

A minimum spanning tree (MST) is a subset of the edges of a connected, edge-weighted graph that connects all the vertices together without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.  

It is a way of finding the most economical way to connect a set of vertices. A minimum spanning tree is not necessarily unique. All the weights of the edges in the MST must be distinct. If all the weights of the edges in the graph are the same, then any spanning tree of the graph is an MST.  

The edges of the minimum spanning tree can be found using the greedy algorithm or the more sophisticated Kruskal or Prim's algorithm.

## How Many Edges Does a Minimum Spanning Tree Have?

A minimum spanning tree (MST) is a subset of the edges of a connected, undirected graph that connects all the vertices with the most negligible possible total weight of the edges. A minimum spanning tree has precisely n-1 edges, where n is the number of vertices in the graph.
