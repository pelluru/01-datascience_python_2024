# Time Complexity
# Finding the cycle in a LinkedList with ‘N’ nodes 
# and also finding the length of the cycle requires O(N). 
# We will need O(N) to find the start of the cycle. 
# Therefore, the overall time complexity of our algorithm will be O(N).

# Space Complexity
# The algorithm runs in constant space O(1).

    def __init__(self, value, next=None):

# Explanation:
# We know for a fact that if there is a cycle, the slow and fast pointers will meet at a point. (see linkedlist_cycle for explanation)
# but how do we know for a fact that if we move the slow pointer in steps of 1 from the point where they collided and another pointer
# in steps of 1 from the head, they are bound to meet at the point where the cycle starts.
# this can be proven mathematically

# 
#               4 - 5 - 6
#             /           \
#   1 - 2 - 3             7
#             \          /
#              10 - 9 - 8
#
# lets label the distance from head to the start of cycle as L1 (ie. 1-2-3)
# lets label the distance travelled by slow pointer till collision with fast pointer as L1 + L2 (where l2 is distance travelled from start of cycle till collision)
# Then we can label distance travelled by fast  pointer as L1 + L2 + X -> since the fast pointer has travelled same distance as slow pointer and some more (x denotes the extra distance)

# S = L1 + L2 
# F = L1 + L2 + X
# if we want to equate the two formulas we have to multiply S by 2 because F has travelled twice its distance
# 2 (L1 + L2) =  L1 + L2 + X
# L1 + L2  = X
# then L1  = X - L2 
#

# if L2 is the distance from start of cycle to collision
# and X is the extra distance travelled by the fast pointer
# and its difference X - L2 = L1,
# this means that the distance travelled from collision to start of cycle will be the same as the distance from head to start of collision
# this explains the solution below
